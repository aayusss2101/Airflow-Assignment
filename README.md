# Airflow Assignment

This repository contains three Airflow DAGs:

## Table DAG - table.py 
The table.py DAG creates a PostgreSQL table named users and inserts some sample data into it. The DAG is scheduled to run daily, and consists of the following tasks:
  - **create_table:** creates the users table if it doesn't exist already
  - **insert_data:** inserts sample data into the users table
  - **select_data:** selects all data from the users table

## Email DAG - email.py 
The email.py DAG sends an email to a specified recipient using the default SMTP connection. The DAG is scheduled to run daily, and consists of the following tasks:
  - **dummy_task:** a dummy task that does nothing
  - **email_task:** sends an email with a subject and some content to a specified recipient

## Slack DAG - slack.py 
The slack.py DAG sends a message to a specified Slack channel using a Slack webhook. The DAG is scheduled to run daily, and consists of the following tasks:
  - **dummy_task:** a task that raises an exception randomly
  - **success_task:** sends a success message to a Slack channel if all tasks succeed
  - **fail_task:** sends a failure message to a Slack channel if any task fails
